Results show large negative effects across many dimensions. Due to {COVID}-19: 13\% of students have delayed graduation, 40\% have lost a job, internship, or job offer, and 29\% expect to earn less at age 35. Moreover, these effects have been highly heterogeneous. One quarter of students increased their study time by more than 4 hours per week due to {COVID}-19, while another quarter decreased their study time by more than 5 hours per week. This heterogeneity often followed existing socioeconomic divides. Lower-income students are 55\% more likely than their higher-income peers to have delayed graduation due to {COVID}-19. Finally, we show that the economic and health related shocks induced by {COVID}-19 vary systematically by socioeconomic factors and constitute key mediators in explaining the large (and heterogeneous) effects of the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Background \& Objective The {COVID}-19 pandemic and resulting cancellation of medical student clinical rotations pose unique challenges to students’ educations, the impact of which has not yet been explored. Design This cross-sectional survey study collected responses from 13 April 2020 until 30 April 2020. Students at {US} allopathic medical schools completed the survey online. Results 1,668 responses were analyzed. A total of 337 (20.2\%) respondents thought the pandemic would affect their choice of specialty, with differences across class years: 15.2\% (53) of first-years ({MS}1s), 26.4\% (92) of second-years ({MS}2s), 23.7\% (162) of third-years ({MS}3s), and 9.7\% (22) of fourth-years ({MS}4s) (p {\textless} 0.0001). Among all classes, the most common reason chosen was inability to explore specialties of interest (244, 72.4\%), and the second was inability to bolster their residency application (162, 48.1\%). Out of the {MS}3s who chose the latter, the majority were concerned about recommendation letters (68, 81.0\%) and away rotations (62, 73.8\%). As high as 17.4\% (119) of {MS}3s said they were more likely to take an extra year during medical school as a result of the pandemic. Region of the {US}, number of local {COVID} cases, and number of local {COVID} deaths had no effect on whether respondents thought the pandemic would affect their specialty choice. Conclusions Our study found that about one-fifth of surveyed medical students currently believe that the {COVID}-19 pandemic will affect their choice of specialty, with many of these citing concerns that they cannot explore specialties or obtain recommendation letters. With prolonged suspension of clinical rotations, targeted efforts by medical schools to address these concerns through enhanced virtual curriculum development and advising strategies will become increasingly important. Further study is needed to explore whether these cross-sectional student perspectives will manifest as changes in upcoming National Residency Matching Program data.},

	title = {The Economic Impacts of {COVID}-19: Evidence from a New Public Database Built Using Private Sector Data},
	abstract = {We build a publicly available database that tracks economic activity at a granular level in real time using anonymized data from private companies. We report daily statistics on consumer spending, business revenues, employment rates, and other key indicators disaggregated by {ZIP} code, industry, income group, and business size. Using these data, we study how {COVID}-19 aﬀected the economy by analyzing heterogeneity in its impacts. We ﬁrst show that high-income individuals reduced spending sharply in mid-March 2020, particularly in areas with high rates of {COVID}-19 infection and in sectors that require in-person interaction. This reduction in spending greatly reduced the revenues of small businesses in aﬄuent {ZIP} codes. These businesses laid oﬀ many of their employees, leading to widespread job losses especially among low-wage workers in aﬄuent areas. High-wage workers experienced a “V-shaped” recession that lasted a few weeks, whereas low-wage workers experienced much larger job losses that persisted for several months. Building on this diagnostic analysis, we estimate the causal eﬀects of policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of {COVID}-19. State-ordered reopenings of economies had small impacts on spending and employment. Stimulus payments to low-income households increased consumer spending sharply, but little of this increased spending ﬂowed to businesses most aﬀected by the {COVID}-19 shock, dampening its impacts on employment. Paycheck Protection Program loans increased employment at small businesses by only 2\%, implying a cost of \$377,000 per job saved. These results suggest that traditional macroeconomic tools – stimulating aggregate demand or providing liquidity to businesses – have diminished capacity to restore employment when consumer spending is constrained by health concerns. During a pandemic, it may be more fruitful to mitigate economic hardship through social insurance. More broadly, this analysis shows how public statistics constructed from private sector data can support many research and policy analyses without compromising privacy, providing a new tool for empirical macroeconomics.},

Many big data studies rely on traces of people’s behavior on social media platforms such as opinions expressed through Twitter posts. How representative are such data? Whose voices are most likely to show up on such sites? Analyzing survey data about a national sample of American adults’ social network site usage, this article examines what user characteristics are associated with the adoption of such sites. Findings suggest that several sociodemographic factors relate to who adopts such sites. Those of higher socioeconomic status are more likely to be on several platforms suggesting that big data derived from social media tend to oversample the views of more privileged people. Additionally, Internet skills are related to using such sites, again showing that opinions visible on these sites do not represent all types of people equally. The article cautions against relying on content from such sites as the sole basis of data to avoid disproportionately ignoring the perspectives of the less privileged. Whether business interests or policy considerations, it is important that decisions that concern the whole population are not based on the results of analyses that favor the opinions of those who are already better off.},

These institutions include eight research universities, nineteen master's universities, and seventeen baccalaureate colleges, as well as thirty-one associates colleges. In addition, there are eighteen institutions classified as special-focus institutions, eleven labeled as baccalaureate/associate's colleges, and two tribal colleges which operate in the state. The University of Michigan system (which comprises three public universities) has been overseen by the Regents of the University of Michigan since 1817.The University of Michigan–Ann Arbor ({UM}) is the flagship campus of the University of Michigan. The oldest post-secondary institution in the state, it was founded in 1817, twenty years before the Michigan Territory achieved statehood. East Lansing-based Michigan State University is the state's largest public institution in terms of enrollment, as it had 50,340 students as of fall, 2016. With an enrollment of 21,210 students, Baker College of Flint is Michigan's largest private post-secondary institution, while Oak Park-based Yeshiva Gedolah of Greater Detroit is the state's smallest.
The state has seven medical schools, as well as five law schools which are accredited by the American Bar Association. The majority of Michigan's post-secondary institutions are accredited by the Higher Learning Commission ({HLC}). Most are accredited by multiple agencies, such as the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education ({CCNE}), the National Association of Schools of Music ({NASM}), and the National League for Nursing ({NLNAC}).},

In this chapter, we argue that researchers must move beyond the permissions granted by ‘legal’ accounts of the use of these new forms of data (e.g., Terms and Conditions) to a more nuanced and reflexive ethical approach that puts user expectations, safety, and privacy rights center stage. Through two projects, we present qualitative and quantitative data that illustrate social media users’ views on the use of their data by researchers. Over four in five report expecting to be asked for their consent and nine in ten expect anonymity ahead of publication of their Twitter posts. Given the unique nature of this online public environment and what we know about users’ views pertaining to informed consent, anonymity, and harm, we conclude researchers seeking to embark on social media research should conduct a risk assessment to determine likely privacy infringement and potential user harm from publishing user content.},
